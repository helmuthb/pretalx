Translating pretalx
===================

pretalx has been translated to other languages, and what's more – you can use
pretalx in several languages for your event, which helps you to be accessible
to a diverse range of people. To make this work, the pretalx interfaces need to
be translated, too.

Translations are **community-sourced**, and **everybody is invited to help**
and make them more complete, improve phrasing, or even **add new languages**!

Official and unofficial languages
---------------------------------

Translations of pretalx are divided into official and unofficial languages.

Official languages
    are translated and maintained by the core team behind pretalx or as part of long-term partnerships. We are
    committed to keeping these translations up-to-date with new features or changes in pretalx and try to offer
    support in this language. Currently, only English and German are available as official languages.

Unofficial languages
    are contributed and maintained by the community. We ship them with pretalx so you can use them, but we can not
    guarantee that new or changed features in pretalx will be translated in time for a new release. Since we
    probably cannot speak the language in question, we cannot guarantee that the translations are
    correct.

All translations marked as unofficial community translations will offered with
a note of how many percent of pretalx they cover. You can see the current
status that will be included in the next release here:

Translating pretalx
-------------------

If you visit `translate.pretalx.com`_ for the first time, it will look a bit bare.

Once you create an account – which you can either do with your email address or
by signing in with GitHub – you can look at and edit translations.

First off, take care to change your preferences so that you'll be presented
with the languages you want to translate. You can do this in your profile
settings, which you can find when clicking your profile picture in the upper
right.

Then, click through the missing translations for your language by going to
the pretalx project dashboard. You can add new translations by clicking on
the “Strings needing action” link for your language.

In the translate view, you can input your translation for a given source
string. If you’re unsure about your translation, you can also just “Suggest” it
or mark it as “Needs editing”. If you have no idea, just “Skip”. If you scroll
down, there is also a “Comments” section to discuss any questions with fellow
translators or us developers.
